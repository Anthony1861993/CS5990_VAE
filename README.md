# CS5990_VAE

Assignment Prompt: Due to the low-dimensionality of the latent space generated by the encoder of VAE, a lot of information from the original input is lost, resulting in blurry/ low-quality images. In this assignment, we will try to enhance the quality of the outputs by increasing the dimension of the latent space. Also make sure to play around with “epochs” to see which produces the best result.
